Subnets with /16, which means that the subnet mask can be written as 255.255.0.0. This subnet can have around 65 thousand hosts.
Subnets with /24, which indicates that the subnet mask can be expressed as 255.255.255.0. This subnet can have around 250 hosts.

sudo nmap -PR -sn 192.168.1.30/24        -----------------------------------------------------
ARP scan is possible only if you are on the same subnet as the target systems. On an Ethernet (802.3) and WiFi (802.11), you need to know the MAC address of any system before you can communicate with it. 


for scanning within same subnet we use arp.
When a privileged user tries to scan targets on a local network (Ethernet), Nmap uses ARP requests. A privileged user is root or a user who belongs to sudoers and can run sudo.
When a privileged user tries to scan targets outside the local network, Nmap uses ICMP echo requests, TCP ACK (Acknowledge) to port 80, TCP SYN (Synchronize) to port 443, and ICMP timestamp request.
When an unprivileged user tries to scan targets outside the local network, Nmap resorts to a TCP 3-way handshake by sending SYN packets to ports 80 and 443.
